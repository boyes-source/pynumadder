This tool adds up numbers in a file using Python!

WARNING! You must not run it like a normal Python file using the `python3` command. You have to run it using the `./test.py yourfile.txt` command. Make sure your file does NOT contain ANY letters or symbols and the tool will add up the sum
of all the lines in the files. 

Example:

`user@users-pc$ ./test.py myfile.txt`

assuming that `myfile.txt` contains the numbers:
5
3
24
56
32
53

The program will print 
`173.0`, which is the sum.
